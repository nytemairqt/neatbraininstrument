To Install:

1. Download & Install Rhapsody Player (free): https://librewave.com/rhapsody/
2. Extract the .LWZ files from this archive and place them somewhere (keep them as .LWZ files).
3. Open Rhapsody -> Add Product -> Manual Install
4. Navigate to either of the .LWZ files -> Click Next
5. Select an installation Directory -> Click Install

As long as both .LWZ files are in the same local directory, Rhapsody should automatically locate the other.
