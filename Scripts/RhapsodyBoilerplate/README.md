# Rhapsody Boilerplate

Boilerplate code and modules used within Rhapsody and Rhapsody instruments.

The majority of the code is released under the GNU GPLv3 but check the headers of individual source files for more details.

Files in the modules folder should be loaded as separate MIDI processors. Files in the includes folder should be included at `on init`.
